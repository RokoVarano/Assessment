# Project Name

> This project is a personal take on the Creative Commons template for Conferences, in which the theme has been customized for a fictional Fantasy Convention. The project includes 3 pages, including "Main", "Tickets" and "About". Though the backgrounds and iconography have been severely altered, the main layout, fonts, and colors have been respected.
